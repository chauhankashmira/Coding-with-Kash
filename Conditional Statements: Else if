Project: Write a code which can give grades to students according to their scores:

Can use conditions – if, else if, and if because we have multiple conditions:

•	90-100, A  Grade
•	70-89, B    Grade
•	60-69, C    Grade
•	50-59, D    Grade
•	0-49, E       Grade

First make one variable; let score =
First condition: if (score >=90 && score <=100) {
                     Both should be True
                     Both should come within the range
                     So that grade value will be “A”
}

Second condition:  else if (score >=70  &&  score <=89) }

}


Do not use hyphen between else and if, only write as two separate words, else if

Now, start writing below codes in the  VS Code (Visual Code Studio) 


//Project: Write a code which can give grades to students according to their scores:

let score = 98;
let grade;

if(score >= 90 && score <= 100) {
    grade = "A";
} else if (score >= 70 && score <= 89) {
    grade = "B";
} else if (score >= 60 && score <= 69) {
    grade = "C";
} else if (score >= 50 && score <= 59) {
    grade = "D";
} else if (score >= 40 && score <= 49) {
    grade = "E";
}

console.log("according to your scores, your grade was : ", grade);

 
Now, refresh browser (html file), within console you will see "according to your score, your grade was : A"
